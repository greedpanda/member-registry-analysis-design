## Changes of the Authentication mechanism according to the Grade 3 review
In order to protect the model *Register* methods from the execution by a not authorized user, we decided to implement the following changes:
 - *boolean getAuthStatus()* method was added to the *AuthenticatorInterface*. *Authenticator* that implements *AuthenticatorInterface* has a private boolean attribute, that is set to true in the *login* method if the user is authenticated;
 - *setIsAuthenticated(AuthenticatorInterface auth)* method was added to the *Register*. This method updates *Register* private boolean *isAuthenticated* inside every loop of the *AppManager* *runApp* method by call to the *getAuthStatus()* method (mentioned above). 
 - in *Register* methods *addMember* and *delMember* we showed that they will execute only if *isAuthenticated* is set to true. The same if conditional check can be implemented in the other methods, that are allowed to be executed only within an authorized user choices (all add and delete boat methods, member and boat edit methods);
